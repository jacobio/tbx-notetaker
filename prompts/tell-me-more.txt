I captured the following term/concept during a meeting or lecture and want to understand it better:

**Topic:** ^value($Name)^

**Context from my notes (optional):**
^action(var:string highest = highestSubling(highestAncestor(original));)^
^value(exportedString($Container(highest), "/Templates/Outline (Markdown)"))^

Provide a concise explanation suitable for a margin note or aside. Include:
- What it is (definition or core idea)
- Why it matters in this context
- One or two concrete examples or key details if helpful

Keep it to 1 to 2 sentences. Write for someone who's competent but unfamiliar with this specific topic. Skip preamble.

If the topic is recent (last 12 months), involves specific products/versions, references current events, or is something you're uncertain about, use web search to verify and expand your understanding. When you find authoritative sources, include inline links in the explanation.

Do not use any of the configured MCP servers.

Return your response as valid JSON with this structure, do not wrap the JSON in a fenced code Markdown block:

{
  "content": "The explanation in Markdown, with inline links where appropriate.",
  "confidence": "High | Medium | Low",
  "searched": true | false,
  "sources": ["https://...", "https://..."]
}
